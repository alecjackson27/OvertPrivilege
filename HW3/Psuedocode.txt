Pseudocode:

1. take a variable-sized input
2. for each char c1 in input string:
	for each digit c2:
		convert c1 and c2 into vectors, v1 and v2 respectively, of size 8, where the elements of the vector are the ASCII binary digits
		c1 = chr((ord(c1) + dotProduct(v1, v2)) % 95) + 32 # modular division while keeping c1 printable ASCII
3. make 33 columns(initialize multidimensional list with sub-lists)
4. add each character to the column corresponding to its index modulo 33
5. each of the 32 character of the hash is the sum modulo 10 of the elements of the corresponding column (from the first 32 columns; the remaining column will be used as a key for shuffling the digits)
6. while the hash contains less than 32 digits:
	calculate the sum of all digits modulo 10
	append this sum to the hash
7. if the key column contains more than 32 digits:
	use the same make columns/add process used to get 32 columns in step 4
   elif the key column contains less than 32 digits
	add '0's until it is 31 digits long, then tack a '3' at the end
   else go to step 7
8. the column key is used to shuffle the columns
9. The shuffled columns, each containing one digit, are converted to 8-bit binary numbers
10. for each digit d1:
	for each digit d2:
		convert d1 and d2 into vectors, v1 and v2 respectively, of size 8, where the elements of the vector are the binary digits
		d1 = (d1 + dotProduct(v1, v2)) % 256
11. for each digit d1:
	d1 = d1 % 16
12. Create final hash. Each of the 32 digits in this hash is the hexadecimal representation of the corresponding digit computed in step 10
