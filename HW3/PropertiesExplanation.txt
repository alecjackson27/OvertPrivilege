Our Function Satisfies the Properties of a Cryptographic Hash Function Through the Following:

Deterministic:
-Our function works the same way every time for any input. A single input will always result in the same output.

Pre-Image Resistant:
-The output's fixed length of 128 bits creates pre-image resistance. The output's higher length also helps create pre-image resistance(sources online indicate that a cryptographic hash function's output should be at least 90 bits long in order to be pre-image resistant. Furthermore, by adding the dot products of vectors created by all the binary representations in the input string to each individual output character, then a slight change in the input results in a drastic change in the output. in essence, changing one character in the input inherently changes all characters in the output.

Collision Resistant:
-No hash function is completely collision resistant, but ours is quite collision resistant. With 128 bits of output and much variation in output, the likelihood of collision is extremely small

Computationally Efficient:
-The hash function's computations are and quickly carried out by a computer. The function calculates its output within a matter of milliseconds

One Way Function:
-Our hash function is one-way only through extensive use of modular addition and dot products
