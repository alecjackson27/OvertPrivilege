once again, I figured I would break the homework down into parts that we could each assign ourselves

create cipher_task1 file using devglan
assignment description says that the public key is shared with us but I don't know where it is

use devglan or sela to create a public/private key pair
encode the given message using the private key
deliver cipher text and public key (list options selected during encoding process)

write cryptanalysis program
    prompt user for plaintext and ciphertext
    output numeric key used for columnar transposition (e.g. 213 for "car")
    key will be between 2 and 7 characters long
    program further broken down in python file

write RSA cryptosystem
    I'll get to outlining this later
